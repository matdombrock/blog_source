# Background

When I first started writing a tech blog, I was using WordPress. At some point, I decided to switch from WordPress to using a static site. For a while, I was experimenting with writing my own static site builder. Eventually a settled for Jekyll because it did what I needed and was a well established project. 

Something about Jekyll never quite sat right with me though. It's a great piece of software, don't get me wrong. I think that my problem with it was personal, and that was that I didn't (and still don't) have any real experience with Ruby (the language Jekyll is written in). The fact that I could not easily dig into the inner workings of the application bothered me as a web developer. Of course I could have just learned some Ruby, but I didn't. 

Around a year ago (maybe less) I started doing some WordPress work and decided (in error I think now) to switch my personal site back to WordPress. At the time, I was taking on a lot of freelance work and I thought that something a little flashier that my Jekyll site could give a nice impression to potential clients. So I got to work moving all of my Jekyll posts over to WordPress again. 

# The Main Problem

The main problem that I've had (and I think I will always have) with using WordPress for a blog is that it just simply has way too much overhead. There is just no reason that a simple blog site needs a database. A database that can go down and be attacked. A database that uses valuable server resources. 

Really, there is just no reason that a simple blog like mine needs to be anything but a static site. There are some solutions out there to use WordPress as a CMS for a static site, but I don't need that either. As a matter of fact, I don't even need a CMS. 

# Other Problems (More Complaining About WP)

If you are a long-time WP developer or even someone who has just been following the project for a while, you will be painfully aware that the WP community is not always exactly "united" when it comes to the direction the project is heading. 

I don't want to get into my opinion on the direction of the WordPress project too heavily here except to say I do not personally think it is heading in a positive direction for the purposes of being used to build a simple blog like this. I think it's reasonable to say that the WordPress core team is no longer targeting users who are just looking for a simple blogging platform. 

Regardless of your personal opinions on the direction of the project, to me the problem remains that WordPress does not feel like a good long-term solution for this blog. 

# Future Proofing

My goal was to find a solution that met the following criteria:

* Written in JS
*
